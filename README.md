# Computer-Networks-VLANs-Trunking-Inter,VLAN,Routing-with-dhcp-dns-server-ACLseciurity-


### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design and configure a secure and fully functional **computer network** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The task covered core networking concepts such as **VLANs, Trunking, Inter-VLAN Routing, DHCP, DNS, and ACL Security**.


### Implementation Steps

#### **1. Network Topology**

* Designed a structured network topology using multiple switches, routers, and end devices.
* Ensured connectivity between different departments (Finance, HR, IT, etc.).

#### **2. VLANs & Trunking**

* Created separate VLANs for each department.
* Configured trunk links between switches for VLAN communication.

#### **3. Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)**

* Configured router sub-interfaces to enable communication between different VLANs.

#### **4. DHCP & DNS Server**

* Implemented **DHCP** to dynamically assign IP addresses to hosts.
* Configured **DNS server** for domain name resolution.

#### **5. ACL Security**

* Applied **Access Control Lists** (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access.
* Enhanced overall security of the network.

#### **6. Testing & Verification**

* Conducted **ping tests** between devices across different VLANs.
* Verified proper functioning of DHCP, DNS, and ACL rules.
